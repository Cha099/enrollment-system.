            <center><h3>Specifications (Software, Hardware and Program)</h3></center><br>
            <p class="ex1"><b>SOFTWARE SPECIFICATIONS </p><br>    
            <p>The software should be easy to execute and the flow of its program are easy to understand, also its performance should be good in order to execute the proposed system. Below are the different software specifications that the system will need to be fullyoperational:</b></p><br> 

            <p class="ex1"><b>Frontend or Client–side </p><br>    
            <p align="justify">As shown in Figure 29 the researchers uses Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and JQuery for frontend or client – side when implementing the proposed system. Bootstrap is a frontend framework for faster and easier for web development. Bootstrapalso includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plug-ins. HTML – stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it allows theuser to create and structure sections, paragraph, headings, links, and blockhouses for webpages and applications. CSS on the other hand is the language for describingthepresentation of web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt thepresentation to different types of devices, such as large screen, small screens, or printers. JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows making web pages interactive by the use of JQuery it is mucheasier tomake JavaScript. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure andstyle to web-pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.</p><br> 
              
	    <p class="ex1"><b>Backend or Server–side </p><br> 
	    <p align="justify">The researchers also use C#.NET, MSSQL for database, and Internet InformationServices (IIS)for back – end / server- side in the said proposed system. .NETis anapplication development framework – it contains numerous libraries containing a rangeof functionality. C# is a language to use with .NET. MSSQL - SQL Server is a databaseserver by Microsoft. The Microsoft relational database management systemis a softwareproduct which primarily stores and retrieves data requested by other applications. Internet Information Services (IIS) is one of the most powerful web servers fromMicrosoft that is used to host ASP.NET Web application</p><br>

	    <p class="ex1"><b>HARDWARE SPECIFICATION </p><br> 
	    <p align="justify">The hardware of the proposed system must handle a lot of documents in order to the system to run effectively. Below are the minimum hardware specifications for the smooth running of the proposed system:</p><br> 
	    <br></br>
	    <p class="ex1"><b> Server–side</p><br>
	    <p class="ex1">16GB RAM PC</p>
	    <p class="ex1">500 GB disk space</p>
	    <p class="ex1">4 CPU Cores</p>
	    <p class="ex1">2GHz processor</p><br></br>

 	    <p class="ex1"><b> Client–side</p><br>
	    <p class="ex1">1.8GHz processor</p>
	    <p class="ex1">8GB RAM PC</p>
	    <p class="ex1">4GB Hard Drive</p>
	    <p class="ex1">22’ color monitor</p><br></br>

	    <p class="ex1"><b> PROGRAM SPECIFICATION</p><br>
	    <p class="ex1">The purpose of this program specification is to execute properly the features of the software and hardware specifications of the said proposed system when implementation begins.</p>
